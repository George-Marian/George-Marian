### Hello there, reader 👋

👋 I'm George, a 22yo informatics student in **Austria**, originally from Romania. 🌍

📚 In my 5th semester, studying **informatics** at IMC FH Krems. *\*PC sounds*\* 💻

🧠 Where's a problem, there's a solution. Even if it feels NP-hard. ➕➖✖️

💻 Mainly working with **Python**, dabbled in **C/C++**, R, JavaScript, HTML/CSS. 🌐

🎨 Love the artsy, also to cook, so I can say I'll see myself doing an amazing art-tech soup soon. 🎭🍲

🌈 Join me in exploring the intersection of art, logic, and technology. 🚀
